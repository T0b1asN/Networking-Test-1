Current task:
	- System to see which of the open windows has focus
		- Have every window check if it gains focus
			- set focus of input
		->Workaround (for now): have windows only lose focus, 
								if they are opened
			- if a window is waiting for a window, 
			  it should reclaim it's focus after waiting
		- ???
	- OwnWindow for inheritance to not declare callbacks in every class

In-between:
	- Function to load audiofiles on runtime not only on start
	- Change size and pos in OwnButton constructor
	- Make prompt for strings in general (not just for names)
	- Own RenderWindow for starting menu, like the namePrompt
	- Max message size

Fix:
	
DO:
	- multiple window support
		- one graphics class/namespace, that holds all windows
			- can request a new one
	1. Multithreading
	2. More sounds
	3. Variable max group size
	4. Commands
	5. Images

Ideas:
	- Server-IDs
		- you are identified
	- Persistant client names on a specific server (one time name enter)
	- Move network stuff on different thread than graphics and other stuff

Finished for new version:
	Major:
		- class for static functions related to pop-ups
			- static function to create a popup
		- COMPLETE restructuring
			- callback-system instead of manually 
			  asking every iteration, if that is a 
			  valid click
		- LogUtil cleaned up
		- moved stuff in new graphics-namespace
		- made InputHandler
		- replaced std::string with sf::String in more places
		- Discord Rich Presence barebones
			- Update works, just needs to be used and maybe changed
