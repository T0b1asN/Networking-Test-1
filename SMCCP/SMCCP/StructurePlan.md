# Structure of the Program
## Networking
* Server
    * GUIServer
    * CMDServer

* Client
    * GUIClient
    * CMDClient

## Graphics
* Window
    * ChatWindow
        * GUIServer
        * GUIClient
    * StartMenu
    * NamePrompt

## Ideas
* Maybe have Server seperatly
    * Server cannot send messages
    * The user starting the server also needs to start a client
