### **Features**
* You can set up a server or connect as a client to a server via the ip adress

2. Press on the button for the server  
3. Enter your nickname in the pop-up  
4. Wait for clients to connect

#### Client
1. Enter the IP address of the server in the textbox in the bottom left corner (server can see it in the top of his window)  
2. Enter the port on which the server is in the textbox in the bottom right corner (server can also see this at the top)  
3. Press on the button for the client  
4. You are asked for a nickname, enter it. If it is already in use on the server, this window will pop up again

Since version 1.1.0 I also provide the debug version of SMCCP.  
The main differences are, that this version doesn't use static linking, so there are dll's. Also the console doesn't close in this version.
