*A chat application to test the features of SFML regarding networking.
I also want to learn networking so it is an ideal project for me. :)*

## **Just works on Windows**

### **Features**
-You can set up a server (at the time only on port 1234) or connect as a client to a server via the ip adress  
	-only works in a local network
-Everyone can write to everyone else in a group  
	-at the moment the group size is fixed to 10 but I plan to make it variable
	
### **Planned features**  
-Commands  
-variable group size  
-variable port  
-a log files for i.e. errors  
-no name doubling  

--------------------------------------

### **How to use**
When you start the application, you see two textboxes and two buttons.
First you enter your name in the top text box, if you want to set up a server, you click on the button for the server
and the server starts.  
When you want to be a client, you also need to enter the ip adress of the server you want to connect to, which can be found at the top of the server application, the standard is your local ip adress, so you normally only need to change the last part of the ip.
After that you click the button for client and the application tries to connect to the server.  
In both cases, server and client, opens a new window. At the top you can find the information of the server or client, for example the name, below that are your messages and at the bottom is the textbox for entering text, which can be send with pressing the enter key.
