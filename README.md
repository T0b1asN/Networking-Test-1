# SMCCP
(simple multi-client chat program)
A chat application to test the features of SFML regarding networking.
I also want to learn networking so it is an ideal project for me. :)

### Features
-You can set up a server (at the time only on port 1234) or connect as a client to a server via the ip adress  
	-only works in a local network
-Everyone can write to everyone else in a group  
	-at the moment the group size is fixed to 10 but I plan to make it variable
	
### Planned features  
-Commands  
-variable group size  
-variable port  
-a log files for i.e. errors
