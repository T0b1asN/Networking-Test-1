# Networking-Test-1
A chat application to test the features of SFML regarding networking.
I also want to learn networking so it is an ideal project for me. :)
	
CC0, of course! :)

### Not finished things - Version 0.2.1
-Just on local PC (planned to be over multiple PCs, but not over the internet)  
-No names for Clients yet  
-just basic disconnecting (on window closing, just when client disconnects, not when server shuts down)  

## DISCLAIMER
### It does not work over WiFi
### I misunderstood tcp sockets, when I uploaded the "fix"
